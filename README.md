# BearHug Project (HackGT)

## Overview

**BearHug Project** is an interactive AI-based system that listens to conversations, empathizes with the speaker, and provides thoughtful responses. The project aims to create a supportive and relatable interaction using advanced natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques.

## Project Structure

The main content lies inside the `HACKGT` folder and specifically in the `server` folder, which houses the Flask-based backend. This folder contains the core logic for the AI interactions and server configurations.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kk-2205/BearHugProjectHackGT.git
   
2. **Navigate to the server folder**:
   ```bash
   cd BearHugProjectHackGT/HACKGT/server
   
3. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment**:

   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
   source venv/bin/activate
   
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. **Run the Flask serve:**:
   ```bash
   flask run
5. **Access the application**:
